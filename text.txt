In the middle of difficulty lies opportunity.
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
When the going gets tough, the tough get going.
Better late than never.
The only way to do great work is to love what you do.
Actions speak louder than words.
Do not go gentle into that good night.
The pen is mightier than the sword.
Every cloud has a silver lining.
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
